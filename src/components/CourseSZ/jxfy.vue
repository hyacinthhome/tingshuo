    <p>&#149;&nbsp;What do you think is the purpose of having post-graduate study? </p>
    <p>I think post-graduate study is a means of improving our job opportunities. There are two reasons: </p>
    <p>1st, nowadays employers are demanding a diploma more and more. In order to be more competitive I think having a higher degree is a correct choice. </p>
    <p>2nd, in modern society, competition is more and more severe; in order to be more competent, we have to be better prepared, and post graduate study provides us with the opportunity to further our study. </p>
    <p>So based on the above two reasons, I think post-graduate study is a means of improving our job </p>
    <p>opportunities. </p>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp;Do you think beautiful female students have an advantage in job interviews? </p>
    <p>Except for some specific occupations, such as a stewardess, or mouthpiece for cosmetics, personally, I don't think so, because: </p>
    <p>1st, there is a saying that you can't judge a person according to one's appearance, being beautiful does not necessarily mean she is excellent in all other aspects, and it doesn't necessarily mean she is the type of person the employers want. </p>
    <p>2nd, during job interviews, what really counts is a person's real ability in answering those questions asked by interviewers and the ability in handling the future job. </p>
    <p>So, really beautiful female students do not always have an advantage in job interviews. </p>
    <p>After all, is Xi Shi really beautiful? </p>
