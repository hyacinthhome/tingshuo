    <p>1 Australia: Australia is an island continent. It contains many different landscapes, but in total is the driest continent in the world. Most of its citizens live in southeast coastal cities. They enjoy doing outdoor activities, and also are enjoying advances in large-scale industry and mining. Australia is a fast growing young nation. </p>
    <p>2 Many important discoveries took place regarding the Earth's interior earlier in this century. The discovery of S-waves and P-waves helped scientists distinguish between the Earth's mantle and core, and also between its mantle and crust. </p>

        Australia-- a huge island continent that lies to the south of Asia. Australians-- a varied people in size, color, and origins. Australia-- more than two hundred years old, a nation that is still growing. <br>
        Its big cities lie on the southeast coast, and this is where most Australians live. Australians prefer to own their own houses, though some live in apartments. Australians are a suburban people. The suburbs surround the cities for many miles, and so efficient transport is of great importance. As the economy grows, so do its industries-- a higher level of production, a wider range of products. <br>
        The Australian works hard, but he likes his leisure. The climate makes outdoor activities the most popular. <br>
        Canberra, the capital of Australia, is a planned modern city located inland. Australia is governed by a parliamentary democracy. The representatives of other countries have their embassies here. Australia wants to strengthen relations with her neighbors. <br>
        Australia is a strange land, a land of vast expanses-- fertile valleys, snow fields and deserts-- also a land with unique animals, many that can not be found on any other continent in the world today. <br>
        Much of the continent is dry, but man has utilized the land, made it productive, with its tools, with its technology. This is the driest continent of all, and water is a precious possession, more precious than all other natural resources. <br>
        But Australia is changing. The land of wool and wheat is now a land of large-scale industry and mining. The costs of developing the new mineral discoveries are enormous, but the rewards are great, too. <br>
        Australia-- a young and developing nation. Australia-- a nation that wants to communicate with its neighbors. </p></td>

        Canada has pieces of landscape to match every spot on the globe, except tropical jungle. In 1867, they joined the pieces together and made a nation of it. And they kept adding to it until 1949 when they finally talked Newfoundland into joining her. <br>
        Canadians are very proud of their sophisticated industries and make things like the fastest autogiro in the world. They are very good at making vehicles of various sorts because they still have to spend much of their time getting from place to place. <br>
        Canadians have a lot of space to fill. They can't cities everywhere… This city is on wheels. When nobody wants to live here anymore, they just move the town away. There are companies who rent towns like this. They'll rent you one for about 5,000 dollars a week and deliver it anywhere in the world. <br>
        It has been said that Canada is the oldest underdeveloped country in the world, that she has the size of China with the population of Iran, that she has the culture development of Afghanistan, the economic structure of the Congo, and the climate of Siberia. But the people who see these things are Canadians. The rest of the world seems to like her. She is generally good-natured. From all we've been able to see of her, she looks just fine. </p></td>

                <br>
        Vocational training has gone through many stages of development in American history. It was given to the children of the poor during the colonial period through the system of apprenticeship. Boys were bound out for a few years to a master, who agreed to teach them a trade and to look after their welfare. Often the agreement required that apprentice be taught to read and write. With the advent of the academy, instruction was given for training in occupations. It was Benjamin Franklin's hope in planning his academy that young people should “learn those things that are likely to be most useful.” He wanted emphasis to be placed on the professions which the young men wished to follow. Other academies were founded with similar purposes. Then came vocational training in high school was that a parent wished to give his child an education which would prepare him for an active life and serve as a basis for a profession. </p></td>

                <br>
        There is a great deal of land in the fifty United States, but there are also a great many people. Where did the people come from? <br>
        The first Americans were Indians. Today there are about 900,000 American Indians. There is one part of the country with an especially large Indian population. That is the southwest. <br>
        Negroes first came to American from Africa as slaves. President Lincoln freed the slaves in 1863. About eleven percent of the present population is Negroes. <br>
        The first immigrants in American history came from England and the Netherlands. Soon immigrants began to arrive from many other countries, and they are still arriving. In 1790 the new nation had fewer than four million people. Today there are more than 300 million. These include people from every part of the world. </p></td>

        In the United States, boys and girls start school when they are five years old. In some states they must stay in school until they are sixteen. Most students are seventeen or eighteen years old when they graduate from secondary school. Another name for secondary school is high school. <br>
        Most children go to public elementary and secondary schools. The parents of public school pupils do not have to pay directly for their children's education because tax money supports the public schools. If a child attends a private school, his parents pay the school for the child's education. <br>
        Today about half of the high school graduates go on to colleges and universities. Some colleges and universities receive tax money from the government. A student at a state university does not have to pay every much if his parents live in that state. Private colleges and universities are expensive, however. Almost half of the college students in the United States work while they are studying. When a student's family is not rich, he has to earn money for part of his college expenses. </p></td>

                <br>
        There have been many great inventions, things that changed the way we live. The first great inventions was one that is still very important today——the wheel. This made it easier to carry heavy things and to travel long distances. <br>
        For hundreds of years after that there were few inventions that had as much effect as the wheel. Then in the early 1800's the world started to change. There was little unknown land left in the world. People did not have to explore much anymore. They began to work instead to make life better. <br>
        In the second half of the 19th century, many great inventions were made. Among them were the camera, the electric light and the radio. These all became a big part of our life today. <br>
        The first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions. The helicopter in 1909. Movies with sound in 1926. The computer in 1928. And jet planes in 1930. This was also a time when a new material was first made. Nylon came out in 1935. It changed the kind of clothes people wear. <br>
        The middle part of the 20th century brought new ways to help people get over disease. They worked very well. They made people healthier and let them live longer. By the 1960's most people could expect to live to be at least 60. <br>
        By this time most people had a very good life. Of course new inventions continued to be made. But man now had a desire to explore again. The world was known to man but the stars were not. Man began looking for ways to go into space. Russia made the first step. Then the United States took a step. Since then other countries, including China and Japan, have made their steps into space. New inventions will someday allow us to do things we have never yet dreamed of. </p></td>

                <br>
        What do we know about the sea? We have all seen it. Most of us have swum or played in it. We know that it looks very pretty when the sun is shining on it. We also know that it can be less pretty when it is rough. What other things do we know about it? <br>
        The first thing to remember is that the sea is very big. Look at the map of the world. There is less land than sea. The sea covers three quarters of the world! <br>
        The sea is also very deep in some places. Sometimes it is less deep. Some parts of the sea are very shallow. But in some places it is very, very deep. There is one spot, near Japan, where the sea is nearly 11 kilometers deep! The highest mountain in the world is about 9 kilometers high. If that mountain were put into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it! <br>
        If you have swum in the sea, you know that it is salty. You can taste the salt. Rivers, which flow into the sea, carry salt from the land into the sea. Some parts of the sea are less salty than other parts. There is one sea, called the Dead Sea, which is so salty that swimmers cannot sink! Fish cannot live in the Dead Sea. <br>
        In most parts of the sea, there are plenty of fishes and plants. Some live near the top of the sea. Others live deep down. There are also millions of tiny living things that float in the sea. These floating things are very small. It is hard to see them. Many fish live by eating them. The sea can be very cold. Divers, who dive deep down in the sea, know this. On the top the water may be warm. When the diver goes downwards, the sea becomes colder and colder. <br>
        Another thing happens. When the diver goes deeper, the water above presses down on him. It squeezes him. Then the diver has to wear clothes made of metal. But he cannot go very deep. Some people who wanted to go very deep used a very strong diving ship. They went down to the deepest part of the sea in this. They went down until they were eleven kilometers deep! </p></td>

                <br>
        I am sure that you are asking, “How does a rocket fly?” if you want to know, get a balloon and then blow it up, until it is quite big. Do not tie up the neck of the balloon. Let go! The balloon will fly off through the air very quickly. The air inside the balloon tries to get out. It rushes out through the neck of the balloon and this pushes the balloon through the air. It does not need wings like an aero-plane. <br>
        This is how a rocket works. It is not made of rubber like a balloon, of course. It is made of metal. The metal must not be heavy but it must be very strong. There is a gas inside the rocket which is made very hot. When it rushes out of the end of the rocket, the rocket is pushed up into the air. <br>
        Rockets can fly far out into space. Rockets with men inside them have already reached the moon. Several rockets, without men inside them, have been sent to other worlds much farther. One day rockets may be able to go anywhere in space. </p></td>

        The inside of the earth is very, very hot. Because it is very hot, the rock has melted like ice. It has become liquid, like water. It is always boiling, like water in a kettle. If you have seen a kettle boiling, you know that the steam and boiling water try to get out. The very hot melted rock inside the earth also tries to get out. Usually it cannot because the outside of the earth is too thick and strong. <br>
        But in some places the outside of the earth is thin and weak. Sometimes a crack (a small opening) appears. The hot melted rock, which we call ‘lava', pushes up through the crack and bursts through. Steam and gas shoot up into the air and the hot melted lava pours out. Big pieces of rock may be thrown high into the air. <br>
        After a while the volcano becomes quiet again. The melted lava becomes hard. Later the same thing happens again and again. Each time more hot lava pours out on top of the cold lava and then becomes hard. In this way a kind of the cold lava and then becomes hard. In this way a kind of mountain is built up, with a hole down the middle. Perhaps the volcano will then be quiet and no more lava will burst out. Perhaps it will start again hundreds of years later. </p></td>

                <br>
        The American expression “burning your bridges” means acting in such a way that you destroy any chance to turning back or changing your actions. <br>
        You can burn your bridges when you are offered a new job. Suppose, for example, that you decide to take the new job. You tell your old boss about your decision. You also tell him how glad you are to leave. <br>
        With these words, you have burned your bridges. Your boss will never let you return to your old job. <br>
        The expression “burning your bridges” gets its name from warfare. An army that is forced back across a river may decide to burn the bridge after crossing it. In this way, the army prevents its enemy from using the bridge. However, the army also destroys its own chance to go back across the river. <br>
        Most people who “burn their bridges” today do not belong to the military. But like those armies, they move in a different direction with no chance of turning back. </p></td>

                <br>
        Americans have used colors to create many expressions they use every day. <br>
        We say we are “in the pink” when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. If I look gray and ashen, I may need a doctor. <br>
        Red is a hotter color than pink. And Americans use it to express heat. In English, the small hot peppers found in many Mexican foods are called “red hots,” for their color and their fiery taste. We say that fast, fiery music, especially the kind called “Dixieland Jazz” is “red hot.” <br>
        Blue is a cooler color. The traditional blues music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful. Duke Ellington and his orchestra recorded a famous song, Mood Indigo, about the deep blue color, indigo. In the words of the song, “You ain't been blue till you've had that Mood Indigo.” To be “blue,” of course, is to be sad. <br>
        While the color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone does not feel well, someone who is seasick for example, we say he looks green. When someone is angry because he does not have what someone else has, we say he is “green with envy.” <br>
        Some people are “green with envy” because someone else has more dollars, or “greenbacks.” Dollars are called greenbacks because that's the color of the back side of the money. </p></td>

        <td valign="top"><p>Goat Phrases <br>
                <br>
        One of the small services the goat has rendered to man is in the way of language. One has merely to think of some of the colorful phrases that go with the word goat to recognize what it has done for the art of expression. <br>
        For example, some men wear “goatees,” thin whiskers that hang down from their chins like the whiskers on a goat. <br>
        Then there is the expression, “to be the goat.” This means to be the scapegoat, to be blamed for something that someone else did. <br>
        Another common expression that has developed in America is “to get one's goat,” meaning to annoy, irritate, upset or anger somebody. When you hear someone say “that really gets my goat,” you can almost feel the heat of anger in the voice. And you know how upset or offended that person is. <br>
        The French have the same expression, and it is said the phrase was used in France more than one-hundred years ago. <br>
        The American version is not that old. Experts believe that the use of the phrase in the United States did not come from the French expression. It was first used in America in 1912, by the novelist Jack London. <br>
        In his book, “Smoke Bellew,” London tells the story of two men crossing a bridge made of snow. The bridge seems to be breaking up. One of the men gets across and shouts back at the other, “Don't look down… that's what got my goat!” </p></td>

                <br>
        The expression “junk food” means food that tastes good but offers little body-building nutrition. <br>
        Every person must eat. We eat so that we can grow and have strength. Food with lots of body-building nutrition is as important to life as the air we breathe or the water we drink. However, we also eat food for another reason: because it tastes good. <br>
        Most foods offer us both nutrition and good taste. Junk foods do not. They taste great. But they usually have little nutrition. <br>
        Americans love junk food: potato chips, corn chips, pretzels, coca cola, Mexican tacos, hot dogs, French-fried potatoes, cookies. On and on it goes. <br>
        Americans are not proud of how much junk food they eat. Scientists and doctors warn often that people should eat less junk food and more good foods, like vegetables, fish, or fruits. The American Heart Association and other health groups say that too much junk food can be one cause of heart disease and other medical problems. </p></td>

                <br>
        The expression “keep your fingers crossed” is a way of wishing someone good luck. <br>
        When a friend tells you that he is going to see someone who may give him a job, you perhaps say, “I'll keep my fingers crossed.” Or you may tell him to “keep his finger crossed.” That, you both hope, will help to get him the job. Sometimes, the friend will actually cross two fingers, but more often just saying it is believed to be enough to help bring success. <br>
        The crossing of fingers when making a wish is hundreds of years old. It comes from the ancient Christian belief in the power of the cross to chase away evil spirits and bring God's grace. <br>
        Many Christians cross themselves in times of crisis or in tense situations that may lead to disaster or success. Soldiers do so before going into battle. So do swimmers at the start of a race, or baseball players as they get ready to swing their bats for a hit. <br>
        There is an old belief that children will not be punished for telling small lies if they cross their fingers. Such unimportant deceptions, it is believed, can do no harm if made with crossed fingers. </p></td>

But still, he thought they were growing too slowly. He got impatient with the young plants. “How could the plants grow faster?” He tossed in bed during the night and could not sleep. Suddenly, he hit upon an idea. He could not wait for daybreak. He jumped out of the bed and dashed to the field. By the moonlight, he began working on the rice seedlings. One by one, he pulled up the young plants by half an inch. When he finished pulling, it was already morning. Straightening his back, he said to himself, “What a wonderful idea! Look, how much taller the plants have grown overnight!” With great satisfaction, he went back home. He told his son what he had done in a triumphant tone. <br>
        His son was shocked. Now the sun had risen. The young man was heart-broken to see all the pull-up young plants dying. <br>
        People now use “Ba Miao Zhu Zhang” to describe the behavior of those who are too eager to get something done only to make it worse. The idiom is a bit like the English proverb “Haste makes waste”—to spoil things by excessive enthusiasm. </p></td>

One man said, “We have only one pot of wine. It's not enough for all of us but sufficient for one. Let's determine who will have the wine by drawing a snake on the ground. He who finishes first will have the wine.” <br>
        The others agreed. So they began the competition. Very soon, one man finished his snake. He was about to drink the wine when he saw the others were still busy drawing. He thought, “I still have enough time to add feet to my snake.” With his left hand holding the pot and his right holding the stick, he began working on his snake again. But before he finished the feet, another man finished his snake and grabbed the pot from him, saying, “Whoever has seen a snake with feet? Yours is not a snake, so the wine should be mine!” He drank the wine. The man adding feet to the snake had to give in and could only regret his foolishness. <br>

        Long long ago, on a hot summer day, a farmer was weeding in the field with a hoe. Suddenly he saw a hare scurrying by and bump into the trunk of a tree. The poor beast broke his neck and died instantly. The farmer stopped hoeing and picked up the dead hare. He was overjoyed at the unexpected gain. He took the hare back home, cooked it and had a nice dinner. While eating his supper, he thought, “How wonderful! Game comes so easily! I'm tired of farming in the hot sun. I have to work hard until autumn before I can reap the crops. Back-breaking work, humph! Why not just sit under the tree and wait for more hares to run into the trunk!” <br>
        The next day, the farmer threw his hoe, indulging himself in the fantasy that he could get another hare. He waited and waited. But his patience did not help. Many days passed but nothing happed. No more hares ran into the trunk. His field was soon overgrown with weeds. Who knows what he lived on the text year if he kept sitting by the tree and doing nothing else! <br>
        From that fable comes the idiom “Shou Zhu Dai Tu.” This metaphor is used to mock people who attempt accidental gains without pains—those who are not willing to make any effort and trust mere luck. It also serves as a good lesson for someone who sticks strictly to his previous experience, but neglects the possibility of change. </p></td>

        About a thousand years ago, during the Northern Song Dynasty, there was a skilled archer named Chen Yaozi. One day, he drew a big crowd while practicing archery on the drilling ground. He shot an accurately that the on-lookers cheers with excitement. <br>
        Chen Yaozi was carried away by applause. He became very proud of himself. But he noticed there was one man in the crowd who only nodded his head, appearing to be quite indifferent to his achievement. This hurt Chen Yaozi's pride. <br>
“Can you shoot an arrow?” he asked the old man, who turned out to be an oil peddler. <br>
“No, I can't.” <br>
“What do you think of my arrow shooting?” he asked further. <br>
“It's okay, but nothing special. You've gained your proficiency through persistent practice, that's all, that's all,” came the reply. <br>
“Then, what can you do?” Chen demanded angrily. <br>
        The old man put a gourd bottle on the ground and covered its mouth with a copper coin which had a hole in the middle. He then scooped out a ladle of oil from his big jar, held it high and began filling the bottle with it. A thread of oil came down from the ladle. It went straight through the hole in the coin into the bottle. Everybody watched it with amazement. When the old man emptied his ladle, he showed the coin to the crowd, asking, “Can you see any oil mark on the coin?” <br>
        They could not. The men were about to give him a big cheer when the old man stopped them. <br>
“There is nothing special about this, either,” he said, “I can do this because I've practiced it a lot. Practice makes perfect. Nothing to be especially proud of.” <br>

        Once upon a time, a man was hawking spears and shields in the street. “Spears! First class spears and strong shields!” very soon, a big crowd gathered around him. <br>
“Look,” said the man, picking up one of his shields. He clanged and showed it to the crowd. “My shields are very strong. Nothing in the world, no matter how hard and sharp it may be, can pierce my shields. Just look at these tough shields!” <br>
        With a proud expression on his face, the man put down his shield and picked up a spear. Brandishing the spear, he said, “My spears are the best under heaven. They are hard and sharp. They can cut through anything, no matter how tough and strong it might be. Come on, buy my spears and shields.” <br>
“Wait a minute,” shouted one of the on-lookers from the crowd, “I wonder if you can tell us what would happen if you were to jab one of your shields with one of your spears.” <br>
“Then…erh…then…,” the seller was tongue-tied. He did not have an answer and the crowd burst out laughing. <br>

        Although I think the United States generally has an excellent system of transportation. I do not think that it does a good job of transporting people between cities that are only a few hundred miles apart. A person commuting between Detroit and Chicago, or between San Francisco and Los Angeles, so called strip cities, may spend only a relatively short time in the air while spending several hours getting to and from the airport. The situation makes flying almost as time—consuming as driving. Moreover, airplanes use a lot of their fuel just getting into the air. They simply are not fuel—efficient on short trips. High speed trains may be an answer. One fairly new proposal for such a train is for something called maglev, meaning a magnetically levitated train. Maglevs will not actually ride on the tracks, but will fly above tracks that are magnetically activated. This will save wear and tear on the tracks. These trains will be able to go faster than 150 miles per hour. At that speed, conventional trains have trouble staying on the tracks. As you can see, maglevs offer exciting possibilities for the future. </p></td>

        How many of you drink cola? Nearly everybody. Did you know that cola started out as a soft drink, but as a cure for headaches back in the late eighteen hundreds? <br>
        John S. Pemberton, a druggist from Atlanta, had experienced for many months trying to find a cure for the common headaches. He worked in his backyard mixing and heating different combination of oils and flavors until he found one which seemed promising. <br>
        Pemberton bottled the mixture and began selling it in drugstores as a concentrated syrup that the customers had to mix with water before drinking. Cola's transformation from a medical syrup to a carbonated soft drink came about quite by accident. One day, a customer came into a drug store complaining of the headache, and asked for a bottle of cola syrup. He wanted to take it right away, so he asked the clerk to mix the medicine while he waited. The clerk, instead of walking to the other end of the counter to get plain water, suggested mixing the syrup with soda water. The customer agreed. And after drinking it, he remarked how good it tasted. The clerk continued offering the mix, and carbonated colas grew in popularity. <br>
        Today, carbonated colas are sold in most countries around the world. And although they no longer contain the ingredients used to kill headaches, they are still very refreshing. </p></td>

        This room is devoted to electric fish. The eel in the park behind me can produce a strong jolt of electricity to stun its prey. But most of the fish in here produce only weak electrical impulses that are useful for navigating, locating food and even for communicating. The knife fish is a good example. This fish navigates using tiny receptors in the skin that are sensitive to electrical impulse. The knife fish produces an electrical signal and the receptors in its skin let it know when the signal is distorted by a tree root or some other obstacle so it can go around it. Fish also use the ability to produce and detect electrical impulses to communicate. They can tell each other what species they belong to, how big they are, and whether they are male or female. We have a tank here that's specially equipped to convert the inaudible signals that the fish produce into sounds you can hear when you put on these headphones. I urge you all to listen in when I'm done speaking. <br>
        Now have a look at the electric rays. Rays are especially interesting to medical researchers because of the organs they use to produce electricity. These organs contain a chemical that carries signals from one nerve ending to the next, not only in rays but also in people. By studying these organs scientists hope to learn more about disease that interpret the transmission of impulses from one nerve to another. </p></td>

And yet did you know that watches and clocks were scarce in the United States until the 1850's? In the late 1700's people didn't know the exact time unless they were near a clock. Those delightful clocks in the squares of European towns were built for the public. After all, most citizens simply couldn't afford a personal time piece. Well into the 1800's in Europe and United States, the main purpose of a watch, which by the way was off on a gold chain, was to show others how wealthy you were. The word “wrist watch” didn't even enter the English language until nearly 1900. By then the rapid pace of the industrialization in the United States meant that measuring time hand become essential. How could the factory worker get to work on time unless he or she knew exactly what time it was? Since the efficiency was now measured by how fast the job was done, everyone was interested in time. And since industrialization made possible the manufacture of large quantities of goods, watches became fairly inexpensive. Furthermore, electric lights kept factories going around the clock. Being “on time” had entered the language and life of every citizen. </p></td>

I realize that the Kensington is vacant right now and not generating any revenue for the town. I also admit that the hotel has gotten a bit dilapidated and unsightly. But the issue is bigger than that. If we destroy the hotel, we will be destroying an important piece of this town's history. The town charter was signed there over 200 years ago and many well-known and important people have stayed there over the years, including the United States president. It wouldn't be all that difficult to fix up the hotel either. In fact if we get some people from around town to volunteer some of their skills and time, we wouldn't have to use any of the town's money or ask the state for money. Once the hotel is refurbished, it could start to attract people to our town again. One last reason to keep the Kensington, we've already got one shopping mall, and that's plenty.

                <br>
        There were several discoveries in the early part of this century that helped geologists develop a more accurate picture of the Earth's interior. <br>
        The first key discovery had to do with seismic waves—remember they are the vibrations caused by earthquakes. Well, scientists found that they traveled thousands of miles through the Earth's interior. This finding enabled geologists to study the inner parts of the Earth. You see, these studies revealed that these vibrations were of two types: compression-or P-waves and shear-or S-waves. And researchers found that P waves travel through both liquids and solids, while S waves travel only through solid matter. <br>
        In 1906 a British geologist discovered that P waves slowed down at a certain depth but kept traveling deeper. On the other hand, S waves either disappeared or were reflected back, so he concluded that the depth marked the boundary between a solid mantle and a liquid core. Three years later another boundary was discovered—that between the mantle and the Earth's crust. <br>
        There's still a lot to be learned about the Earth. For instance, geologists know that the core is hot. Evidence of this is the molten lava that flows out of volcanoes. But we're still not sure what the source of the heat is. </p></td>

                <br>
        So why did what is now called modern dance begin in the United States? To begin to answer this question, I need to back track a little bit and talk about classical ballet. By the late 1800's, ballet had lost a lot of its popularity. Most of the ballet dancers who performed using the rigid techniques that had been passed down through the centuries. Audiences and dancers in the United States were eager for their own contemporary dance form and so around 1900 dancers created one. So how was this modern dance so different from classical ballet? Most notably, it wasn't carefully choreographed. Instead the dance depended on the improvisation and free personal expression of the dancers. Music and theory were of little importance to the modern dance. And lightness of movement wasn't important, either. In fact modern dancers made no attempt at all to conceal the effort involved in the dance step. But even if these improvisations appeal to audiences, many dance critics were less enthusiastic about the performances. They questioned the artistic integrity of dancers who were not professionally trained and the artistic value of works that had no formal structure. Loi Fore, after performing fire dance, was described as doing little more than turning around and around like an eggbeater. Yet the free personal expression of the pioneer dancers is the basis of the controlled freedom of modern dance today. </p></td>

        In the late 1400's, when Christopher Columbus returned to Spain from the western hemisphere, he brought with him a sample of what the native Americans called maize, or as we call it more often today, corn. The corn that Columbus introduced to Europe was the distant descendant of a grass native to Mexico. The peoples of the Americans probably started to domesticate this grass as early as 500 BC. After about a thousand years, they had developed a highly productive strands of corn which later became the basis for the great pre-Columbian civilizations. Figuratively speaking, both the cities of the Incas and the temples of the Mayas were built on corn. Domesticated corn and the people who cultivated it developed together. Without humans to care for it, domesticated corn could not survive. The kernels are crowded together beneath the strong protected husk and silk. And the young corn shoot is not strong enough to break through the husk on its own. If people did not strip away the husk and plant individual kernels, the corn would die out. </p></td>

        We've just seen two contemporary large birds that cannot fly—the emu and the ostrich. Over here is an interesting specimen from the past. This stuffed animal is not the giant penguin it appears to be, but an auk. This particular kind of auk is very rare—only 78 skins are known to exist and most are not preserved as well as this one. The great auk, as you can see, was a rather large bird, and it couldn't fly either. However, evidence suggests that the auk was an excellent swimmer and diver. Unfortunately, those abilities didn't protect it from being easy prey for hungry sailors who years ago sailed the very cold and often icy waters of Greenland, Iceland and Scotland. In fact, records indicate that the auk was rather tasty and that its eggs—Excuse me…that its eggs and feathers were useful as well. Still, it isn't clear what other factors led to the big bird's demise around 1844, the last time anyone reported seeing one. Of course, we believe it's important to take extra precautions to preserve the remaining great auk skins. After all, these specimens should prove invaluable for future scientific research. </p></td>

                <br>
        The brain controls most of the body's activities. Messages between the brain and the spinal cord are carried by nerves which are made up of special cells called nerve cells. Nerve cells have long string—like fibers that carry messages. These fibers have branched ends to send and receive messages. Remember that nerve cells are so small that they cannot be seen without a microscope. But one fiber from a nerve cell may stretch as long as three feet. There are many kinds of nerve cells, and this chapter deals mainly with three kinds. The sensory nerve cells carry messages of heat, light, sound, and pressure from the skin, muscles and organs inside the body. Motor nerve cells carry messages to the muscles, and this causes the muscles to move. Connecting nerve cells go between the sensory nerve cells and motor nerve cells. All these different nerve cells help us see, hear, taste, smell, and feel. </p></td>
