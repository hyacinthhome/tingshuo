        American officials have begun investigating some of former President Clinton's last acts in office. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department are studying Mister Clinton's decision to pardon businessman Marc Rich. They want to know if friends of Mister Rich tried to buy the pardon. <br>
        Congressional committees have begun their own investigations of several of Mister Clinton's pardons. Two committees are looking at the money given to the Democratic Party by Mister Rich's former wife. Reports say Denise Rich has given about one-million dollars to Democratic candidates and causes in recent years. She also gave four-hundred-fifty-thousand dollars for a project to build a library to hold Mister Clinton's presidential papers. <br>
        The former President denies any wrongdoing. Mister Clinton says he approved the pardon based on what he thought was right. <br>
        Marc Rich fled the country in Nineteen-Eighty-Three to avoid arrest by federal officials. He has lived in Switzerland ever since. Mister Rich was charged with cheating and failing to pay more than forty-eight-million dollars in taxes. He also was charged with taking part in illegal oil deals with Iran. The Presidential pardon means he cannot be tried on any of these charges. <br>
        Presidential pardons have been part of American history since the country was established. The United States Constitution gives Presidents the right to pardon people for crimes or possible wrongdoing. <br>
        In Seventeen-Ninety-Five, for example, President George Washington pardoned two leaders of what was called the Whiskey Rebellion. They had led a campaign by grain farmers who violently opposed a federal tax on whiskey products. <br>
        Perhaps the most famous pardon took place in Nineteen-Seventy-Four when President Gerald Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon. Mister Nixon had resigned from office after Congress threatened legal action against him. <br>
        Some historians say President Ford may have lost the presidential election of Nineteen-Seventy-Six because of the Nixon pardon. But they say the act helped to ease what was a tense American political situation. <br>
        In his last several days in office, Mister Clinton gave pardons to about one-hundred forty people. Many people are questioning why some of the pardons were given. Congress or the courts cannot change a legal pardon. <br>
        Now, some members of Congress are suggesting the need for a constitutional amendment to restrain a President's right to offer pardons. Many other lawmakers and legal experts say it would be a mistake to try to limit the pardon power of the President. <br>

        One of President Bush's first foreign policy actions was to end government aid to international family planning groups that support operations to end pregnancies. These operations are called abortions. President Reagan started this policy in Nineteen-Eighty-Four. President Clinton suspended the policy in Nineteen-Ninety-Three. <br>
        <br>
        The policy says that private international family planning groups that receive American government aid must stop performing abortions. The only exceptions are if an unmarried woman became pregnant by a family member or if a pregnant woman's life was in danger. International groups that receive American aid are also not allowed to support abortion as a method of family planning. <br>
        <br>
        Supporters of Mister Bush's decision say the policy honors the cultural and religious values of many developing countries. One group that supports Mister Bush's decision is the United States National Right to Life Committee. <br>
        <br>
        The group's spokeswoman is Olivia Gans. She says that renewing the policy is important. That is because it permits foreign governments to set their own policy on the issue. In addition, she says it will help countries realize that America honors their laws on abortion. She says President Bush's decision has taken the United States out of the business of selling abortions in other countries. <br>
        <br>
        However, other groups have criticized the decision. They say it may lead to a rise in unsafe and dangerous abortions around the world. <br>
        <br>
        Marie Stopes International is a health agency based in London. The organization estimates that seventy-five-thousand women in the world die each year from unsafe abortions. In addition, it says hundreds-of-thousands of women suffer permanent health problems from unsafe abortions. <br>
        <br>
        Samantha Guy is spokeswoman for Marie Stopes International. She says President Bush's decision is dangerous because the number of unsafe abortions in developing countries will rise. <br>
        <br>
        She says many private agencies will not be able to provide methods of birth control if they no longer receive American aid. So women in developing countries will not have safe ways to prevent pregnancies. Women who do not get such help will be forced to take action. Mizz Guy says they likely will choose unsafe abortions instead of pregnancy. This is especially true if they already have many children. <br>

        Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared a state of rebellion earlier this week. She took the action to halt violent demonstrations in Manila. Thousands of demonstrators tried to enter the Presidential Palace on Tuesday. They clashed with security forces surrounding the building. Four people died in the violence. One-hundred others were injured. <br>
        The demonstrators were protesting the arrest on April twenty-fifth of former Philippine President Joseph Estrada. Mister Estrada is accused of gaining eighty million dollars illegally during his presidency. He was ousted from the office in January. Vice-president Gloria Arroyo was sworn in as president. Mister Estrada says he is innocent of the charges against him. <br>
        His supporters say Ms. Arroyo's reaction to their protests is illegal and undemocratic. The declaration of a state of rebellion gives police wide power to arrest and hold people. It also bars groups of more than five people from gathering near the presidential palace. The state of rebellion was declared for Manila only. <br>
        Mizz Arroyo also ordered the arrests of eleven politicians. Philippine officials say the opposition politicians plotted to take over the government. Intelligence reports accuse the group of planning to kill both President Arroyo and former President Estrada. The reports say Senators Juan Ponce Enrile and Gregorio Honasan and former police chief General Panfilo Lacson planned to head the new government. <br>
        Ms. Arroyo says she hopes by Monday to be able to declare the rebellion is over. Philippine citizens are to vote in congressional and local elections a week later, on May Fourteenth. It will be the first vote since Mister Estrada was ousted. Candidates loyal to Mister Estrada say Ms. Arroyo's recent actions were connected to the election. They say she used her power unfairly to hurt their chances in the vote. <br>
        A political expert and supporter of Ms. Arroyo says Mister Estrada's supporters are trying to escape responsibility for the violence. He says voters will reject them for that. <br>
        Other experts say it is Ms. Arroyo's political coalition that willsuffer in the elections. Public opinion experts say Mister Estrada is very popular among the poor in the Philippines. They say many are angry about his arrest. About ninety percent of the eighty-million Filipinos are poor. <br>
        On Thursday, President Arroyo made a surprise visit to Mister Estrada.He is being held in a jail near Manila. An adviser to the president says Ms. Arroyo only wanted to see the conditions in which Mister Estrada was being held. Yet, the leader of Mister Estrada's political party said the visit could mean more than that. He said it might be the beginning of a settlement between the Philippine government and Mister Estrada. <br>

        Arguments are increasing in the United States both for and against sentencing convicted criminals to die. The death penalty debate is caused by the planned execution of convicted murderer Timothy McVeigh. He is to be the first person executed by the federal government since Nineteen-Sixty-Three. <br>
        Thirty-eight states permit a convicted criminal to be sentenced to death. Last year eighty-five people were executed in the United States. <br>
        McVeigh placed a powerful bomb near a federal government building in Oklahoma City in Nineteen-Ninety-Five. The explosion killed one-hundred-sixty-eight people, including nineteen children. <br>
        McVeigh has admitted he is guilty of murdering the most people in American history. His execution by injection of chemicals was set for next week. However, on Friday, Attorney General John Ashcroft postponed the execution until June eleventh. The Justice Department announced Thursday that thousands of pages of evidence had been found. The F-B-I should have given defense lawyers these documents before McVeigh's trial. Mister Ashcroft ordered an investigation, but said McVeigh was still guilty. <br>
        Recent public opinion studies show more than seventy-five percent of Americans support McVeigh's execution. These include many Americans who usually oppose death sentences. <br>
        Kent Scheidegger is with the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California. It is a victims' rights organization that supports the death penalty. Mister Scheidegger says McVeigh is a perfect example of why there is a need for a federal death penalty. He says anything less than the death of McVeigh would show a complete lack of justice. <br>
        Groups opposed to the death penalty say the approval of the execution of McVeigh does not show an increase in general public support for the death penalty. Opinion studies show that support for the death penalty has decreased. Studies show seventy-seven percent of Americans supported it five years ago. Now about sixty-three percent do. <br>
        Ajamu Baraka directs an anti-death penalty program for Amnesty International in the United States. He says the death of McVeigh will do little to change the debate. However, he expects a strong international reaction to the McVeigh execution that could help death penalty opponents. <br>
        Opponents of the death penalty have always argued that it was unfair. They say poor people who can not pay for good legal help receive the death penalty more often than others. And they say courts order the death penalty more often when the accused is member of a racial minority group. <br>
        Former President Bill Clinton called for a government study of the issue before he left office. The results of the study are expected to be released soon. Nineteen more federal prisoners are sentenced to be executed. <br>

        The United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, estimates that about two-hundred-thousand children a year are sent to West and Central Africa as slaves. This problem became a major international news story last month. At that time, a Nigerian boat believed to be carrying up to two-hundred-fifty child slaves sailed from Benin. It went missing after it was turned away from ports in Gabon and Cameroon. Benin and UNICEF officials searched the boat when it returned to Cotonou two weeks later. <br>
        <br>
        However, only forty-three children were found on the ship. Some were with their parents. U-N officials are not sure what happened to the rest of the young passengers. Africa has the highest rate of child labor in the world. UNICEF estimates forty-one percent of children between the ages of five and fourteen are put to work. Girls are the worst affected. They usually work in people's homes. Or they are forced to sell sex as prostitutes. Boys are usually forced to work on farms or as fishermen. Often the children work long hours in poor conditions. They receive little or no pay. <br>
        <br>
        Most child slaves in Africa come from the continent's poorest countries, such as Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali. Parents sell their children to traders for as little as fifteen-dollars. Parents hope their children will find a better life in a richer country. Usually, the young people are transported long distances over land and sea to Gabon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Often the trip can be deadly because the boats may not have enough food and fresh water. <br>
        <br>
        West African governments understand the problem and are trying to stop it. Last year, Mali and Ivory Coast agreed to work together to fight the trade of child slaves between their countries. They also announced a number of measures to help children who return home. <br>
        <br>
        Most West African countries have signed a U-N agreement protecting the rights of children. They have also signed the International Labor Organization's agreement to stop the worst forms of child labor. Officials say both measures need to be put into effect in order to guarantee that children are protected from slavery. <br>

        Researchers say lakes, soil and trees in the northeastern United States continue to suffer from the effects of acid rain. Acid rain is caused by nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide gases in the environment. <br>
        Energy companies were required to make more cuts in nitrogen and sulfur pollution in Nineteen-Ninety under amendments to the Clean Air Act. But researchers say acid rain still threatens fish and trees. They say much larger cuts in the gases that cause acid rain are needed. <br>
        The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation in the state of New Hampshire prepared the new study about acid rain damage. Many of the findings are similar to those of earlier studies. But the new study gives more evidence about the harm being done to plant and animal life. <br>
        Scientists blame coal-burning factories in the Ohio River valley of the middle west for most of the nitrogen and sulfur pollution in the northeast. Winds carry the pollution toward the east. It mixes with moisture and then falls as rain, snow or fog. This is called acid rain. Compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in acid rain change the chemical balance of soil and bodies of water. The soil and water change from being chemically neutral to acidic. <br>
        Researchers say acid rain has led to a sharp reduction of red spruce and maple trees across the northeastern United States. Scientists had thought the trees were dying because of insects, lack of water or a warming climate. But the study suggests that acid rain weakens plant life and prevents trees from getting important nutrients. <br>
        High levels of acid rain are also affecting waterways in the northeastern states. This makes it difficult for fish, plants and other organisms to survive. <br>
        For years, lawmakers from the northeastern United States have proposed legislation in Congress to reduce nitrogen and sulfur gases in the environment. But the bills have gained little support outside the northeastern area of the country. Lawmakers from middle western states strongly oppose such laws. <br>
        Last month, a group of senators proposed legislation that would reduce the amount of acid rain gases that energy companies and other industries can release. <br>

        An international team of scientists is studying the problem of pollution and dust in Asia. One-hundred-thirty scientists from twelve countries have gathered in the western Pacific area to observe thick dust storms. They will observe the dust storms as they mix with some of the world's heaviest pollution. <br>
        The thickest dust storms in recent years were reported in Beijing, China and other Asian cities last spring. The dust storms came from deserts in China and Mongolia. This year, similar dust storms have begun moving east toward large Asian cities and the northwest Pacific Ocean. <br>
        The dust storms happen in winter over deserts high above sea level. In the spring, the storms move east, over large cities in China, Japan and Korea. By summer, rainstorms break up the dust and help reduce pollution in the air. <br>
        The scientists plan to observe the dust storms through the middle of May. They are using research ships, airplanes, satellites and instruments on the ground to gather information. <br>
        The study is known as the Aerosol Characterization Experiment, or ACE-Asia. The American National Center for Atmospheric Research reported on the study. <br>
        Aerosols are very small particles in the air. The scientists are studying aerosols that contain sulfate and carbon. They are produced by the burning of soft coal, wood and plants. Barry Huebert of the University of Hawaii is the lead investigator for the study. He says developing nations in Asia use a mixture of fuels that are not used in other areas. <br>
        Richard Dirks of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research is the director of field operations for the study. He will supervise the study from project headquarters in Iwakune, Japan. He says the study will help scientists better understand how human activities affect Earth's climate. He notes that the project involves countries that have not worked together in the past. <br>
        ACE-Asia is the third in a series of pollution studies. The first was based in Tasmania, Australia. The goal of that study was to measure pollution levels in a clean environment. The second study was in the Canary Islands. Scientists there studied pollution from Europe mixing with dust from the Sahara Desert. This year, the scientists are measuring the heaviest aerosol pollution on Earth. <br>

        The Bush administration has proposed a measure that would temporarily suspend part of the Endangered Species Act. The law has been the main tool used by citizen's grops to win protection for plants and animals. President Bush requested the measure in his new budget that he sent to Congress earlier this month. <br>
        The plan would make it more difficult for citizens and environmental groups to take legal action against the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency often faces legal action by groups seeking to force the government to list a species as endangered or threatened. <br>
        The administration's proposal would continue to permit citizens and environmental groups to take legal action to force the Wildlife Service to act on endangered species requests. But it would limit how much money the agency could spend to carry out new court orders or settlements. <br>
        The plan also would let the wildlife agency establish which species should be considered first under the Endangered Species Act. The agency also would have more power to decide which areas should be barred from any development. <br>
        About one-thousand-two-hundred kinds of plants and animals are now on the agency's endangered list. Most of them were listed as a result of legal pressure brought against the agency by other groups. <br>
        Environmental groups say legal action forces the Fish and Wildlife Service to obey the rules of the Endangered Species act. They say blocking their efforts would harm rare plants and animals.The Bush administration's proposal is part of a continuing battle about how far the government should go to establish which species need protection. Agency officials say too much time and money is spent dealing with legal actions and not enough on protecting species. They say an increasing number of legal actions has delayed decisions on about two-hundred-fifty species waiting to be considered. <br>
        Businesses and government agencies have criticized the endangered species law since it was established in Nineteen-Seventy-Three. They say environmental groups use the law to block development projects. But environmental groups say the law provides the only protection for rare plants and animals. <br>

        Eight people were awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize last week in San Francisco, California. The Goldman Environmental prize is the world's largest award honoring environmental activists. <br>
        The Goldman award is given every year to environmental heroes from each of the world's six continents. Prize winners receive one-hundred-twenty-five-thousand dollars. Many of this year's winners faced great risks to protect their environment. <br>
        Yosepha Alomang of West Papua, Indonesia was one of the winners. She organized resistance to the world's largest gold mining company. She accused the company of destroying mountains, rivers, rainforests and native cultures. Mizz Alomang continues to peacefully organize native communities seeking protection of traditional lands. <br>
        Two television reporters in the American state of Florida also won the Goldman prize. Jane Akre and Steve Wilson tried to report on the possible health risks to people caused by a hormone fed to cows. R-G-B-H is banned in most other industrial nations. The television station refused to broadcast the report and dismissed Mizz Akre and Mister Wilson from their jobs. <br>
        Eugene Rutagarama of Rwanda was another winner. He fought to save the country's endangered mountain gorillas during ethnic wars in the nineteen-nineties. Mister Rutagarama helped rebuild Rwanda's national parks to protect the gorillas' environment. It was threatened by millions of people who were resettled by the government after the wars. <br>
        Bolivian worker Oscar Olivera also won the Goldman prize. He led a coalition to protest the government's sale of the public water system in one of Bolivia's largest cities to an American company. The protests and negotiations forced the Bolivian government to cancel its sale. <br>
        Greek scientists Giorgos Catsadorakis and Myrsini Malakou also received the prize. They led an effort to create community programs to help protect Greece's Prespa wetlands. Their work led Greece, Albania and Macedonia to create a joint protected area. <br>
        The final winner was Bruno Van Peteghem of the South Pacific islands. He worked to protect one of the world's largest coral <br>
        reefs. The reef in New Caledonia was threatened by mining companies. Mister Van Peteghem is leading a campaign to place the reef on the World Heritage list and guarantee its permanent protection. <br>

        Scientists have tried for years to understand what is causing frogs to disappear around the world. Since Nineteen-Eighty, at least twenty kinds of frogs have disappeared. Many explanations have been proposed. They include pollution, infections and unidentified environmental threats. <br>
        Scientists have warned about the possible harm to the environment caused by warming of the Earth. Now researchers say they have evidence that climate change could be a cause of the frog deaths. The findings are the first to link climate change with the decreasing frog population in North America. <br>
        A team of researchers studied frog eggs in small bodies of water in the northwestern American state of Oregon. Joseph Kiesecker led the study in Oregon's northern Cascade Mountains. <br>
        Scientists have known for years that frog eggs in the western states are dying from a fungal infection in water. The latest research suggests that the infection is the result of a complex series of events caused by warming temperatures. <br>
        The scientists believe the frogs' eggs become infected because water levels where the eggs are laid are too low. They say climate change has reduced the amount of rainfall in areas where the frogs lay their eggs. Lower water levels permit more dangerous ultraviolet light from the sun to reach the eggs. Ultraviolet radiation can cause the eggs to lose their ability to resist deadly fungal infections. <br>
        The researchers had done other experiments in the mountains. In those studies, scientists thought that ultraviolet radiation from the decreasing amount of ozone in the atmosphere was causing the frog deaths. Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun. <br>
        Some scientists disagree with the new study. They say the effects of ultraviolet radiation in Oregon probably would not happen anywhere else. They also disagree about whether the fungal infection is the direct cause of the frog deaths. Some scientists say the fungus could have developed in the eggs after they had already died of a different cause. <br>
        Scientists note that not all of the world's frogs lay their eggs in water. They say there are probably many reasons for the decreasing populations of frogs around the world. <br>

        Most doctors have long believed that reducing salt can decrease blood pressure. A new American study suggests this is true even when people do not eat the healthiest foods. <br>
        The research appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. A team at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts performed the study. Frank Sacks of Harvard University Medical School led the team. <br>
        More than four-hundred people took part in the research. Almost half of them had high blood pressure. They all ate foods with different amounts of salt. Salt contains sodium. There is strong evidence that sodium affects blood pressure. <br>
        Half the people ate an average American diet. Their food was high in fat and cholesterol. The other people ate low-fat, low-cholesterol foods. Members of the low-fat group ate many vegetables, fruits and grains. <br>
        The study showed that the people who ate healthful foods while eating less salt lowered their blood pressure the most. However, blood pressure decreased for both groups when they ate less salt. Almost fifty-million Americans have high blood pressure. Continued high-blood pressure is dangerous because it can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. <br>
        Philip Greenland of Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, Illinois praised the study. He said the decreases in blood pressure among the people in the study were similar to those caused by medicine. However, Doctor Greenland said popular prepared foods need to be improved if people are to decrease salt in their diets. He said most people get their salt mainly from these prepared foods. They include many soups and cooked meat products. <br>
        The Salt Institute is an association representing the salt industry. The institute does not dispute the research results. But it says the results show a low-fat diet reduces blood pressure better than reducing salt. The Salt Institute also says efforts to reduce sodium use have proved impossible for twenty years. <br>
        David McCarron is a medical professor at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. He says salt does not make much difference in controlling blood pressure when people eat the right foods. Doctor McCarron says healthy diets should include fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products. <br>

        Some scientists believe that a mother with the disease AIDS who breastfeeds her baby increases the baby's chance of getting the disease. However, a new report has found that women infected with the AIDS virus put their babies in greater danger by not breastfeeding them. <br>
        Michael Latham is a professor of international nutrition at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He and another expert went to Africa last year to examine AIDS programs and policies. The two scientists spoke with government and non-government officials in Kenya, Uganda, Namibia and Botswana. They discovered an unnecessary fear that breastfeeding causes higher cases of the H-I-V AIDS virus among babies. Instead, Mister Latham says only three to six percent of babies are likely to become infected if they receive breast milk from an infected mother. <br>
        Peter Lamptey leads AIDS prevention programs for an international public health organization in North Carolina. He says another study has results similar to Mister Latham's report. The study was done in South Africa in Nineteen-Ninety-Nine among mothers with H-I-V and their babies. The researches discovered that a baby's chances of getting H-I-V depends on what the baby is fed. <br>
        The study found that only eight percent of babies given only breast milk in their first three months of life became infected with the AIDS virus. Thirteen percent of babies given only processed milk for babies, or formula, became infected. But twenty percent of babies who were given both formula and breast milk became infected with H-I-V. <br>
        Doctors call this last method “mixed feeding.” They say it may cause AIDS to be spread quickly from mother to baby for two reasons. First, formula may damage the walls of the baby's intestine. Second, the breast milk of a mother with H-I-V can cause her baby's intestine to become even more infected. <br>
        Instead of “mixed feeding,” doctors say breast milk is the best way to protect against the AIDS virus. Even if the mother is infected, her body develops antibodies against the disease that are passed on to her baby. <br>
        Experts say more studies are needed. However, Mister Latham hopes his research will teach mothers with AIDS that breastfeeding is a safe and helpful process. <br>

        Two new studies have added to the evidence that drinking a little alcohol each day is good for the heart. Earlier studies have shown that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol reduces the chances of suffering a heart attack or a stroke caused by thickening of the blood. <br>
        The new studies were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. One group of researchers was from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. They questioned almost two-thousand patients at forty-five hospitals. All the patients had just suffered heart attacks. The researchers asked them how much alcohol they drank in the year before the heart attack. Those who had fewer than seven alcoholic drinks a week were considered light drinkers. Those who had more than seven drinks a week were considered moderate drinkers. <br>
        The researchers studied the patients' health for the next four years. At the end of that time, the light drinkers had a twenty-one percent lower chance of dying from a heart attack than those who never drank at all. The moderate drinkers had a thirty-two percent lower chance of dying than those who never drank. The drinkers survived mostly because they had fewer additional heart attacks. <br>
        The other study involved more than two-thousand older men and women. Their average age was seventy-four. Researchers from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia asked them how much alcohol they drank. The researchers studied the health of these people for up to fourteen years. They found that those who had one or two drinks each day were twenty to fifty percent less likely to develop heart failure than those who did not drink. <br>
        Both studies found no difference in survival among people who drank beer, wine or liquor. <br>
        Arthur Klatsky is a heart doctor at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, California. Doctor Klatsky said both studies strengthen the idea that drinking a small amount of alcohol each day can protect the heart. Alcohol thins the blood and prevents clots that block arteries. It also increases the so-called good cholesterol in the blood that helps keep arteries open. <br>
        However, other health risks have been linked to moderate drinking. And Doctor Klatsky said heavy alcohol drinking is a sure way to damage your health. <br>

        When the weather is warm and sunny, people around the world spend more time outside. However, doctors have been warning for years that being in the sun for too long can burn the skin. It can also cause more serious health problems, including skin cancer. <br>
        <br>
        The World Health Organization says two-hundred-thousand cases of the most serious kind of skin cancer, malignant melanoma, develop each year. More than fifty-thousand Americans are expected to develop melanoma this year. The American Cancer Society says almost eight-thousand Americans will die from the disease this year. <br>
        <br>
        Malignant melanoma begins in body cells that produce a brown color. It usually first grows in a small dark area of skin called a mole. Melanoma most often is recognized as a dark area with an unusual shape. <br>
        <br>
        An operation to remove the cancerous cells can cure melanoma if the cancer has not spread. Doctors treat melanoma that has spread with chemotherapy. The drugs kill any cancer cells that were not removed in the operation. Radiation also may be used to kill cancerous cells and reduce the size of any cancerous growths. <br>
        <br>
        The five-year survival rate for melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes is thirty to forty percent. It is only twelve percent if the cancer has spread to other organs. <br>
        <br>
        Doctors say too much sunlight can cause melanoma. This is especially true for people who have light skin and were burned by the sun when they were young. Some people are more likely than others to develop melanoma. These include people whose family members had the disease. They also include people who have a large number of moles on their bodies. <br>
        <br>
        Doctors say people should always protect their skin from sunlight. They should wear a hat and protective clothing. They should use a sun protection liquid. Doctors also say everyone should examine their bodies often for any changes in moles or the presence of new ones. They should go to a doctor if any mole has an unusual shape or if it has several different colors. Another warning sign of melanoma is a mole that is larger than six millimeters across. <br>

        A new American study is disputing the theory that all humans alive today developed from a single group of early humans. The study found that the ancestors of modern humans came from many different areas of the world, not just one. <br>
        Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and other scientists organized the study. Their findings were reported in Science magazine. <br>
        The findings are the latest in the continuing dispute about how modern humans developed. Many scientists believe that all humans are genetically linked to a single group of ancient humans. They say that this group probably lived in Africa about one-hundred-thousand years ago. <br>
        Fossil remains show that other early humans were alive from this time back to almost two-million years ago. However, there is no more recent evidence of such creatures. Some scientists say this means that all the other early humans must have died out. <br>
        Mister Wolpoff and other scientists question this theory. They believe that small groups of early humans traveled out of Africa over thousands of years. They traveled to Asia, Europe and even as far as Australia. They reproduced with a more ancient kind of human who already lived in those areas. They say there is little evidence that a small group from one area replaced the entire population of early humans. <br>
        In the new study, the scientists examined some of the earliest known fossils of modern humans. They examined the head bones of ancient humans from Australia and Europe. The bones are believed to be twenty-thousand to thirty-thousand years old. <br>
        The scientists compared these skulls with older Australian and European fossils. They also compared the skulls with even older fossils from Africa and the Middle East. <br>
        The scientists found that the Australian and European skulls were similar in appearance to the more ancient fossils from Africa and the Middle East. The skulls also were similar to more ancient remains from Australia and Europe. The scientists say there were many more similarities than could be explained by chance alone. <br>
        Mister Wolpoff rejects the idea that what he calls one lucky group developed into early humans. He says the fossils clearly show that more than one ancient group survived and developed. <br>

        American scientists have developed the first material that repairs itself. The material is a form of plastic that has been engineered to fill breaks in its surface. <br>
        Plastics are used today in everything from airplane wings to hundreds of objects found in the home. Scientists wanted to find a way to make objects made of plastic last longer. The researchers hope their new discovery can be used to make objects that are difficult or impossible to replace. <br>
        The surface of plastic objects breaks over time. Very small breaks, or cracks, develop every time a plastic object is used. The researchers wanted to find out how to stop plastic from developing small cracks that grow, weaken and destroy it. The research team at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana found an answer to the problem. They found the answer in the chemical structure of plastic itself. <br>
        Plastic is made of small molecules called monomers. These monomers link together to form very long molecules called polymers. Polymers give plastic its ability to be shaped and its strength. <br>
        The research team found a way to make plastic that contains very small balloons filled with liquid. The liquid contains monomer molecules — the building material of plastic. The team then created solid plastic that contains a special chemical. This chemical is called a catalyst. A catalyst is a substance that starts a chemical reaction. <br>
        The new plastic still cracks like common plastic. But, when it does, the monomer liquid is released and flows into the crack. The catalyst in the solid plastic then reacts with the liquid monomer. The chemical reaction between the liquid monomer and the catalyst creates polymer molecules that repair the break. The repaired plastic has seventy-five percent of the strength of undamaged plastic. <br>
        The scientists say the new self-repairing plastic is not yet ready for production. But it has several possible uses. One could be in space vehicles where parts cannot be repaired or replaced. Another possible use might be in bridges. And it could be used in people, to replace bone joints that have become broken or damaged. These include knees or hips. The leader of the study is Scott White, a professor of engineering. He says the material is able to repair itself just as the human body is able to heal itself. <br>

        Agriculture officials in Britain are attempting to stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. The disease was found in pigs last month at a meat production center in Essex, east of London. More cases have been reported among farm animals in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The disease has been found in more than thirty areas in Britain. Officials have ordered the killing of at least eleven-thousand animals. <br>
        Britain and the European Union have banned exports of live animals, milk and meat products until the crisis ends. British officials also have asked the public not to visit farm areas to avoid spreading the virus that causes the disease. <br>
        Foot-and-mouth disease is one of the animal diseases that farmers fear most. The disease spreads widely and quickly. It can cause severe production and economic losses. <br>
        Foot-and-mouth disease affects cows, deer, goats, pigs and sheep. Affected animals develop cuts in their mouths and on their feet. Many affected animals recover. However, the disease weakens them. The disease is not considered dangerous to people. But people can carry the virus on their clothing and shoes. <br>
        Experts say the virus can live for long periods in the body of an animal and in animal products and wastes. The virus also is able to survive in the air and in water and fields. <br>
        Experts say foot-and-mouth disease spreads quickly unless it is discovered early and stopped immediately. They say farmers can support efforts to prevent its spread. Experts urge farmers to watch for signs of the disease, such as an animal having difficulty walking. Another sign is large amounts of fluid leaking from the mouth. Farmers should immediately report any unusual sign of disease to local experts or disease control officials. <br>
        There are at least seven forms of the foot-and-mouth virus. One or more versions can attack animals at the same time. An animal can suffer repeated attacks of the disease. This is because natural resistance to one form of the virus does not protect it against other versions. <br>
        Foot-and-mouth disease is one of the most difficult animal infections to control. The disease is found in many parts of the world. Different forms of the virus have been identified in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. <br>

        Scientists have completed the largest study yet on the safety of cellular telephones. The study involved more than four-hundred-twenty-thousand people in Denmark. <br>
        The researchers found that cell phone users are no more likely than other people to develop cancer. However, the study failed to end the debate over cell phone safety. Critics say it will be years before evidence of cancers linked to cell phone use is confirmed. <br>
        Cellular telephones may be the best-selling electronic devices in the world. Cell phones are small, wireless devices. They are held close to the user's head during normal use. Their widespread use has led to increased concerns about possible health risks. <br>
        The antennas on these phones produce low levels of radio wave radiation while in use. Most of the debate about the phones involves the amount of radiation they release. Scientists know that intense electromagnetic radiation can harm human tissue. But they are not sure if the radiation from cell phone antennas could cause serious damage. <br>
        The Danish Cancer Society and the International Epidemiology Institute near Washington, D-C organized the new study. Researchers identified Danes who began using cell phones between Nineteen-Eighty-Two and Nineteen-Ninety-Five. <br>
        The researchers compared this information with Danish health records. The researchers found that the cell phone users developed the expected numbers of cancers. They found no increased risk for cancers of the brain, nervous system, mouth or blood. <br>
        The Journal of the National Cancer Institute published a commentary with the study. Robert Park of the American Physical Society wrote that cell phones are dangerous – when people use them while driving cars. He said the large number of people in the study makes it difficult to question the findings that cell phones do not cause cancer. Recently, two smaller American studies also found no increased cancer risk. <br>
        Not everyone agrees, however. For example, researcher George Carlo has written books about cell phone safety. He says other studies suggest that cell phone use may damage genes. He warns that cancers of the brain develop over many years. <br>

        The Internet computer system is helping many people start and operate businesses. But to use the Internet, a person has to learn how to use a computer. A person also needs a telephone line or satellite connection. However, about half the world's population have never even made a telephone call. And most poor people do not own a computer. For these people a “digital divide” exists. <br>
        Two meetings were held in the United States to discuss what can be done. One was called the “Digital Dividends Conference.” It was held in Seattle, Washington. Officials from large American information technology companies attended. Representatives from non-governmental organizations, or N-G-Os, also attended. <br>
        These people are working to make it easier for poor people to use the Internet. Many American companies provide money to N-G-Os for their programs. Microsoft is the largest computer software company in the world. It has set up an organization to give money to many N-G-Os. <br>
        The head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, spoke at the meeting. Mister Gates has given hundreds of millions of dollars to help people in developing countries fight diseases like malaria and AIDS. He said that people have to be healthy before they can use computers and the Internet. <br>
        Another conference was held at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D-C. It was called “Voices of the Poor.” It was supported by the British Department for International Development. About one-hundred people from N-G-Os and poor people's organizations from around the world attended. They told about using the Internet to teach poor children about computers and business in many places around the world. <br>
        They also told about how providing wireless telephones to poor village women has changed their lives. The women are able to sell telephone services to other people in the village. Everyone who attended the meeting learned that many organizations around the world are using computers and the Internet to help reduce the digital divide. <br>

        The United States Department of Agriculture is honoring the work of the Tropical Agriculture Research Station. Agricultural Research magazine reports that the research station will celebrate its one-hundredth anniversary this year. The American government research center is based on the island of Puerto Rico, an American territory. <br>
        Ricardo Goenaga is the head of the Tropical Agriculture Research Station. He says the center studies tropical fruits that are economically important to the United States. Mister Goenaga says changes in the diet of many Americans and population changes have increased demand for such fruits. <br>
        He notes that Puerto Rican farmers now grow mango plants on about eight-hundred hectares of land to provide for the increased demand for the fruit. He says most of the mangoes are exported to the United States mainland and Europe. <br>
        Some crops studied at the station already grow on American territory. Others are from warmer climates. Mister Goenaga says the center tests fruits in different environments to identify where the crops grow best. He notes that Puerto Rico has three-hundred different kinds of soil. Also, different rainfall levels are reported on different parts of the island. <br>
        One major goal of the research station was the collection of tropical plants from around the world. Currently, about two-thousand kinds of plants are grown at the center. Many are not native to Puerto Rico. They include cinnamon, rubber, vanilla, black pepper, and camphor. Mister Goenaga says the center receives requests for plants from many countries. <br>
        The research station is working with international agencies to study plants that are resistant to the disease black sigatoka. Black sigatoka is the disease most harmful to plantain and banana plants. It attacks plant leaves and reduces fruit production. The disease is not present in Puerto Rico. However, it has been reported in other Caribbean countries and in the American state of Florida. <br>
        Mister Goenaga says future research will be on developing tropical fruit production systems. The goal is to help growers improve their production and expand the markets for their fruits. He says improving the nutrition of the fruits is also important. <br>

        A new report says people are harming the Wolong Nature Reserve, China's largest protected area for giant pandas. The report says the environment in the nature reserve is being destroyed quicker than in other parts of China that are not protected. This is causing a decrease in the panda population in the nature reserve. Research scientists from the United States and China did the study. Science magazine published their findings. Giant pandas are becoming increasingly rare in the wild. Only about one-thousand of the animals live in the mountains of southwestern China. <br>
        Chinese officials established Wolong Nature Reserve in Nineteen-Seventy-Five. It covers two-hundred-thousand hectares of land in Sichuan Province. It is home to ten percent of China's wild panda population. <br>
        However, the number of pandas in Wolong has decreased since the reserve was created. The research team says there were one-hundred-forty-five pandas in the reserve in Nineteen-Seventy-Four. Twelve years later, the panda population fell to seventy-two. The team says the number probably is even smaller today. <br>
        Giant pandas live in mountain areas where there are plenty of forests. They eat mainly bamboo plants. The researchers compared the rates of change in Wolong's forests and environment before and after the reserve opened. They examined satellite images taken since Nineteen-Sixty-Five. <br>
        The researchers found that humans have taken control of large parts of Wolong. Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University led the study. He says human settlements have grown in the reserve, mainly because it has so many visitors. The human population has increased by seventy percent since the reserve was created. The people are cutting more trees for fuel and other uses. This has destroyed areas where pandas live. <br>
        Mister Liu's team says the best hope for Wolong is to improve education for the young people who live there. Then they can get jobs and move to other parts of China. <br>
        A panda expert at the World Wildlife Fund says China has more than thirty other protected areas for giant pandas. Most of them are not threatened by human activities. And she says panda protection is becoming very important in China. <br>

        Irrigation is the watering of land by other than natural methods. Irrigation projects provide water for plants in areas that have long periods of little or no rainfall. A new study shows how irrigation projects can help improve the lives of people in different ways. The study found that irrigation projects have helped improve crop production in parts of Africa that have little rain. It also found that irrigation improved the health and diets of people in those areas. <br>
        The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization announced the findings. The U-N agency has said that increasing the use of irrigation could be the answer to feeding the world's people. <br>
        F-A-O officials say irrigated land is almost three times as productive as cropland dependant on rain. They say thirty to forty percent of the world's food comes from irrigated land. <br>
        During the next thirty years, about seventy percent of the additional food production in developing countries is expected to come from irrigated land. However, only four percent of African farmland south of the Sahara Desert has irrigation. <br>
        In the new study, F-A-O officials studied small irrigation projects in Burkina Faso, Mali and Tanzania. They found that the addition of small dams and wells resulted in changes in all three countries. For example, local people earned more money. They could pay for health care. And they could eat healthier foods. <br>
        In all three projects, irrigation increased food production or earnings by enough to provide an extra meal each day. This was true even during the period before the harvest. <br>
        For example, the report said a local dam in Mali gave farmers water to increase food production. The project also led to the production of new crops, such as vegetables rich in vitamins. <br>
        In Burkina Faso, some of the money earned from the sale of farm products was invested in health care. F-A-O officials say visits to local health care centers rose fifty percent over three years. In some families, the amount of money spent on health care rose from five to twelve percent. <br>
        In Tanzania, some women in villages traditionally spend hours getting water. The addition of wells meant that the women had time for more productive activities. So the women were trained to grow their own crops. <br>

        When scientists look up into the night sky, they see stars, planets and the moon. There is also dark matter – the material between the stars and planets. Scientists believe dark matter makes up much of the matter in our universe. However they have not been able to explain where it is. Although scientists have discovered signs of its gravity, no one has been able to see dark matter – until now. <br>
        Recently a team of international scientists discovered observable dead stars -- or dark matter -- at the edge of our own Milky Way galaxy. The experts announced their discovery in Science Magazine. They said they found thirty-eight objects called “white dwarfs.” <br>
        Each white dwarf is a burned up, dying star like the sun. However, each one has shrunk to about the size of Earth. These newly discovered white dwarfs are said to be about four-hundred-fifty light years from Earth. A light year is the distance that light travels in one year. <br>
        Ben Oppenheimer led the research team that discovered the white dwarfs. He works at the University of California at Berkeley. He says the team studied pictures of the white dwarfs taken during the past thirty years. The movement of the objects suggests that they are in the so-called “halo” of the universe. This is a very large circular collection of stars and gas that surrounds our Milky Way galaxy. <br>
        This is important because the halo is much larger than the Milky Way galaxy itself. The researchers suggest that there are many white dwarf stars throughout this halo. This discovery would explain much of the mass that cannot be found in our galaxy. <br>
        Mister Oppenheimer says most of the white dwarfs may be about ten-thousand-million years old. Scientists believe the universe was born about thirteen-thousand-million years ago after a huge explosion of matter called the Big Bang. <br>
        Scientists estimate that most of the dark matter in our universe is made up of unusual particles. These particles do not contain protons or neutrons found in atoms. Scientists have not been able to identify these particles. <br>
        Some scientists are calling this discovery of observable dark matter historic. They say the findings raise many questions about how stars and our galaxy were formed. They also say the discovery opens the way for more study of some of the unexplained matter. <br>

        American researchers say a new study has found that a substance made from the plant known as Saint John's Wort is not effective in treating serious depression. <br>
        Depression is a feeling of deep sadness that continues for at least fourteen days. People who are depressed may have decreased energy, feelings of guilt or thoughts of killing themselves. They may experience changes in how much they eat or sleep. They may be unable to work or care for their families. Some kinds of depression are more severe than others. <br>
        Saint John's wort has become very popular in the United States to treat depression. It is sold in many stores. Researchers say the latest study is the first large scientific trial of Saint John's wort in patients suffering serious depression. It involved two-hundred people at eleven medical centers in the United States. <br>
        The patients received either Saint John's wort or an inactive substance. After eight weeks, the researchers found no real difference between the group taking Saint John's wort and the group taking the inactive substance. <br>
        Richard Shelton is a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He led the study and published the results in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He said the study means that people suffering depression should not take Saint John's wort. They should go to a doctor and receive medicine that is known to help depression. <br>
        The new results dispute the findings of at least twenty earlier studies. These studies showed that Saint John's wort did help people suffering a less serious kind of depression. So Doctor Shelton and the other researchers re-examined their study results. They looked for any effects from Saint John's wort on less serious depression. <br>
        Again they found that the substance was not effective. Doctor Shelton said no proof exists to support the use of Saint John's wort for any kind of depression. But he also said more studies are needed to confirm the findings of his group. <br>
        He said a larger study is being done at the National Institutes of Health near Washington, D-C. It is examining the effects of three substances on depression. They are Saint John's wort, an inactive substance and a popular medicine for depression. Results of that study are expected later this year. <br>

        A new American study has found that organic farming is not only good for the environment. The study found that organic farming can increase profits for farmers. It also found that trees grown organically can produce better tasting fruit. <br>
        Scientists from Washington State University organized the study. Their experiment is believed to be one of the first to compare the effectiveness of organic farming with other methods. <br>
        Organic farmers do not use chemicals to increase their crops or to control insects, weeds and disease. Many people believe eating organic food is more healthful than eating food produced with chemicals. Americans are willing to pay more for organic food products. Organic food is one of the fastest growing areas of American agriculture. The number of organic farmers is growing at a rate of about twelve percent each year. <br>
        In the study, the scientists grew Golden Delicious apples on three experimental farms in Washington state. The scientists used a different method on each farm. On one farm, they treated the apple trees with fertilizer products and chemicals to kill insects. <br>
        The scientists used organic farming methods to grow apples on the second farm. They used natural wastes as fertilizer and biological methods to control insects. On the third farm, the scientists used both methods. They added chemical treatments, but limited their use. <br>
        The Washington State University scientists kept detailed records of their experiment. They measured the different kinds of fertilizer and chemicals used. They even measured the amount of fuel used by farm machinery. The scientists produced an environmental report for each growing method. Nature magazine reported their findings. <br>
        The scientists found that the organic system took longer than the other methods to earn a profit. However, organic farming was the most energy efficient and did the least harm to the environment. It provided more profit by the end of the six-year study. People who tasted all the apples said the organic apples tasted the sweetest. <br>
        Several agricultural experts praised the study. But others questioned the findings. They noted that some organic crops may grow well in Washington State, but not in other areas. <br>

        Spiders are very small. So it is easy to think that they do not make anything strong. However, a scientist at Oxford University in Britain has discovered this it not true. David Knight says that eight-legged spiders create a material called silk that could be as strong as rope. <br>
        <br>
        Mister Knight has been studying spiders and the natural silk material they produce for many years. The main subject of his research is the complex chemical process that spiders use to make their silk. Mister Knight's findings were published recently in the British magazine, Nature. <br>
        <br>
        Mister Knight says that silk is very thin. But it is extremely strong. This is because the threads of silk are made into a complex structure. Mister Knight says the silk is made from protein molecules. It forms in the parts of the spider's body called silk glands. The silk is like pieces of string. It is rolled into small balls. <br>
        <br>
        When the spider wants to make, or spin, some silk, it carefully unrolls the balls. The pieces of string join together. When the spider wants to move, it joins all the small strings of silk into one long thread. Then it can move down the thread. Wherever a spider goes, it spins a silk thread behind itself. <br>
        <br>
        Mister Knight says that spiders can make and use as many as seven kinds of silk. It uses one kind of silk for making the structure of the spider's web -- where it traps insects. It uses another stretchy silk for making round links in the web. Mister Knight says those links are covered by another kind of silk that is very sticky. This sticky material makes it difficult for insects to escape after they are caught in the spider's web. <br>
        <br>
        Spider silk is strong enough to catch insects. Its strength can be measured. Mister Knight says the silk from an Orb web spider is five times stronger than fiber made by man. He also estimates that a rope of spider silk as thick as one pencil could pull a large ship through the water. He says one day people may be able to make material as strong as a spider's silk. It could be used in place of rope. <br>
        <br>
        Spider silk is a useful material. It does not harm the environment. It can be re-used by spiders. So people may wonder why they cannot use spiders to manufacture silk for industrial use. Mister Knight says it is because spiders can not be farmed. He says if you put them in a room together, they will try to eat each other. <br>

        American officials have released a plan to reduce the risk of farm animals infecting people with disease. The United States Department of Agriculture and two other organizations developed the plan. They are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians. <br>
        <br>
        Officials say recent reports of harmful bacteria linked to farm visits showed the need to develop the plan. Last year, fifty-six Americans in two states became sick with the bacteria. Nineteen of them were admitted to hospitals. <br>
        <br>
        The bacteria are called E. coli. People affected by E. coli bacteria often suffer from uncontrolled expulsion of body wastes. They may lose blood or suffer kidney failure. The effects sometimes can cause death, especially among children, very old people and people with weakened defenses against disease. <br>
        <br>
        Many children love to visit farm animals. The director of the Centers for Disease Control says young visitors may be putting themselves at risk of getting a life-threatening infection, such as E. coli. He says supervisors of these areas and parents of children who visit them should be informed of the risks. <br>
        <br>
        The new plan says anyone organizing visits to farm animals should inform people about the problem. It says organizers also should offer ways to prevent the spread of infection from animals to people. <br>
        <br>
        Officials say farm animals should not be permitted at eating places or areas for young children. They say places where people visit farm animals should have a separate area where animals are not permitted. The officials say people should be permitted to touch animals only under close supervision. <br>
        <br>
        The plan says both the animal-free area and the meeting area should have hand-washing stations. People should wash their hands immediately after visiting the animals. <br>
        <br>
        American officials say some activities should not be permitted during visits to farm animals. They include eating and drinking, smoking cigarettes and carrying playthings. <br>
        <br>
        The officials say most people become infected with E. coli by swallowing food or liquids mixed with animal waste. They note that touching animals or their surroundings can also lead to infection. <br>
