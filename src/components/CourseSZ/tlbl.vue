    <p>&#149;&nbsp;As the quality of university students is deteriorating, do you think universities should put more restrictions on students' graduation? </p>
    <p>A: Yes, because a lot of students believe that when they enter the university in China they will </p>
    <p>receive their diploma/degree easily. When a university places more restrictions on </p>
    <p>graduation the students will study harder and the quality of their studies will match the </p>
    <p>expected abilities for the degree. </p>
    <p>B: No, because I don't believe an examination actually reveals a student's true abilities. </p>
    <p>Additionally, Chinese education is already quite slanted toward the over use of examinations, </p>
    <p>which I believe causes a lack of quality in their education as a whole. Right now, most </p>
    <p>students are only concerned with passing an exam and not the content of what they are </p>
    <p>studying. </p>
    <p>&#149;&nbsp;Should marriage be allowed in college? </p>
    <p>A: Yes, because it is the right of every adult human being who is over 18 to be able to get married in accordance with the Chinese law, And, I believe that the institution of marriage promotes responsibility in both partners because they can help each other in their studies and in life. </p>
    <p>B: No, because as college students their only focus and undivided attention should be totally devoted toward their studies and nothing else. Being married as a student in college is nothing more than a complicated distraction. Additionally, marriage may restrict social development as two married people devote more time to themselves and not others. </p>
